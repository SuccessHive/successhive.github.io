      <title>Demystifying Career Guidance</title>

      <description>In the digitally connected modern world, we are moving away from the notion of viewing work and life as two separate components. Work is increasingly being embraced as a subset of life and we are moving towards the understanding that the quality of one&amp;rsquo;s work directly impacts the overall quality of one’s life.
We spend 70% of our adult lives working, thus it becomes critical that our work be something that we don’t just excel at, but also love and something that adds value to us and makes our lives enriching.</description>
